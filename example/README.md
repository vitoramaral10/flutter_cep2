## API Usage Examples

The example demonstrates various ways to use the flutter_cep2 package:

### Basic Usage
```dart
final cepService = FlutterCep2();
final result = await cepService.search('01310-100');
```

### With Error Handling
```dart
try {
  final result = await cepService.search(cep);
  // Handle success
} on CepException catch (e) {
  // Handle CEP-specific errors
} catch (e) {
  // Handle other errors
}
```

### Different Output Formats
```dart
// JSON format (default)
final jsonResult = await cepService.search('01310-100');

// XML format
final xmlResult = await cepService.search(
  '01310-100',
  output: CepOutputFormat.xml,
);
```

### Resource Management
```dart
final cepService = FlutterCep2();
// Use the service...
cepService.dispose(); // Clean up resources
```

This example serves as both a demonstration and a reference implementation for integrating flutter_cep2 into your own Flutter applications.
